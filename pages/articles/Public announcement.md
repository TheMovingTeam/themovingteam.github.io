After months of work, it is finally time to announce that the open beta is nearing it's opening time.

<!-- excerpt -->

Move has been in development for almost three months now with a lot of experimentation and personal growth in the process.

It released in a closed beta for my friends and family last month to iron out most issues regarding the core functionality of the app.

Since then I've moved on to support 13 different services across 8 different regions and it's quickly approaching the threshold of an open beta in Spain!
